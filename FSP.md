## 1. Routing: Fyle system

- After you create a file like `about.tsx`, the route `http://localhost:3000/about` will be available
- It works even if you create a folder like `tutorials` and put a file `javascript.tsx` inside, it will be available on `http://localhost:3000/tutorials/javascript`

## 2. Code Splitting

- Out of the box, automatic, no need for special code
- When we run `npm run build`, Next automatically generates a file for each route we have
